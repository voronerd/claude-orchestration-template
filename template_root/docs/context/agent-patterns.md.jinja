# Agent Patterns (On-Demand and Parallel Execution)

{% if has_local_llm %}
## On-Demand Agent Invocation (@reviewer / @tester)

@reviewer and @tester are invoked **on-demand**, not automatically. Other agents recommend them; the Hub decides.

| When to Invoke | Agent | Trigger |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| After code generation | @reviewer | @local-coder recommends (>20 LOC or new public API) |
| After code review | @tester | Generate tests for reviewed code |
| After bug fix | @tester | @debug recommends (regression test) |

**Order matters:** @reviewer BEFORE @tester (review code first, then write tests on clean code).

## Parallel Agent Execution

When tasks are independent, spawn multiple agents in a single message for 2-3x speedup.

**Parallelize:** Independent file reads, multi-model reviews, tests for separate modules
**Serialize:** Task B needs Task A's output, same file modifications, build -> test chains

**Cost note:** Parallel agents burn tokens simultaneously. Consider if parallelism is worth the cost for expensive agents.
